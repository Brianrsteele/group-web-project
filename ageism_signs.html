            <h3>Have you experienced ageism in the workplace?</h3>
            <div id="example">
            	<dl>
            		<dt><b>Terms like "Culture Fit".</b></dt>
                        <dd> Older applicants and workers are often told they will be let go or won't be hired because they aren't a good fit with the "culture" of the firm. Employers aren't allowed to use age as a basis for firing or not hiring an employee, but "culture fit" is much more nebulous and hard to define.</dd>
                    <dt><b>Terms like "Recent College Graduates/Digital Natives".</b></dt>
                        <dd>"Recent college graduates" doesnâ€™t specifically discriminate by age, but it is a way of limiting new hires to younger workers.</dd>
                    <dt>Older workers are fired while younger workers are hired.</dt>
                        <dd>This is a sure sign that an employer is trying to cull out older workers.</dd>
                    <dt>When performance evaluations suddenly go from good to bad.</dt>
                        <dd>Poor performance evaluations are often cited as a reason to let older workers go. If evaluations went from good to bad over the course of a couple of years, that might be a sign that an employer wants to get rid of an employee for being too old.</dd>
                    <dt>Job reassignment.</dt>
                        <dd>Taking an employee away from a long time position and giving them a less attractive set of duties is a way to encourage them to leave before they have to be laid-off.</dd>
                    <dt>Not getting raises, especially when your performance has been strong.</dt>
                        <dd>Like job reassignment, withholding raises can be a way of encouraging older employees to leave early.</dd>
                    <dt>Comments about age.</dt>
                        <dd>A manager or employer who begins joking about when you are going to retire may be a sign of ageism.</dd>
                    <dt>Joking in an unflattering way about age.</dt>
                        <dd>Jokes about not being able to use technology, calling someone unflattering names based on their age, or making jokes about the sexuality of older adults are all signs of agism.</dd>
