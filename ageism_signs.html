            <h4>Terms like "Culture Fit".</h4>
                
            <p> Older applicants and workers are often told they will be let go or won't be hired because they aren't a good fit with the "culture" of the firm. Employers aren't allowed to use age as a basis for firing or not hiring an employee, but "culture fit" is much more nebulous and hard to define.</p>
                
            <h4>Terms like "Recent College Graduates/Digital Natives".</h4>
                
            <p>"Recent college graduates" doesnâ€™t specifically discriminate by age, but it is a way of limiting new hires to younger workers.</p>
                    
            <h4>Older workers are fired while younger workers are hired.</h4>
                        
            <p>This is a sure sign that an employer is trying to cull out older workers.</p>
                    
            <h4>When performance evaluations suddenly go from good to bad.</h4>
                    
            <p>Poor performance evaluations are often cited as a reason to let older workers go. If evaluations went from good to bad over the course of a couple of years, that might be a sign that an employer wants to get rid of an employee for being too old.</p>
            
            <h4>Job reassignment.</h4>
                        
            <p>Taking an employee away from a long time position and giving them a less attractive set of duties is a way to encourage them to leave before they have to be laid-off.</p>
                    
            <h4>Not getting raises, especially when your performance has been strong.</h4>
                        
            <p>Like job reassignment, withholding raises can be a way of encouraging older employees to leave early.</p>
                
            <h4>Comments about age.</h4>
                        
            <p>A manager or employer who begins joking about when you are going to retire may be a sign of ageism.</p>
                    
            <h4>Joking in an unflattering way about age.</h4>
                        
            <p>Jokes about not being able to use technology, calling someone unflattering names based on their age, or making jokes about the sexuality of older adults are all signs of agism.</p>
