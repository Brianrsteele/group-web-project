            <h3>What is Ageism?</h3>

            <p>In 1964, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. The law stated that employers could not hire, fire, promote, or set wages based on the age of a worker. It specifically banned discrimination against workers over forty years old. It also banned the specification of age preferences or limits while hiring.<sup>1</sup>  Fifty-five years later, workers over forty years old still face difficulty with finding and keeping employment, even in high tech fields where the demand for workers is high.</p>

            <p>According to USA Today, the median age of most workers in the U.S. is forty-two. Meanwhile, at Facebook the median age is 29, and Google, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft have similar median ages. Most candidates for jobs at those firms are between twenty-five and thirty-four years old. Companies find younger workers attractive because they are more likely to work for minimal salaries, will be willing to work longer hours that older workers, and are up-to-date on new technology skills than older workers.<sup>2</sup></p>

            <p>Writing for Wired magazine, Karen Wickre described the challenges she faced as a fifty-two-year-old who was hired at Google. She noted that companies like Google are working hard to have a more diverse workforce, and are deliberating hiring workers of color, workers with a variety of sexualities, and workers who bring unusual experiences into Google. However, hiring older workers and valuing them for their experience is overlooked in diversity discussions.</p>

            <p>While Wickre found that her age gave her a lot of confidence at work, there were some situations, especially teambuilding exercises, that could be challenging to navigate. Her advice for companies was to remember that equitable team building exercises shouldn’t involve sports or alcohol. Also, older workers need mentorship and professional growth opportunities as much as younger employees. Finally, not every older worker is interested in going into management, and older workers have family care needs like eldercare that younger students don’t have.<sup>3</sup></p>
